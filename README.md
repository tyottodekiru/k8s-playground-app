# K8s Playground

A web-based Kubernetes playground that allows users to easily create and manage temporary Kubernetes environments using Docker-in-Docker (DinD) technology. Perfect for learning, testing, and experimenting with different Kubernetes versions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-version Kubernetes Support**: Create environments with different Kubernetes versions (1.30-1.33)
- **Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure login using Google accounts
- **User-Specific Environments**: Each user manages their own isolated set of k8s playgrounds
- **Browser-based Terminal**: Interactive shell interface using xterm.js for cluster interaction
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic environment cleanup after 24 hours
- **Internal Browser Support**: Access services within the DinD k8s cluster
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices-based design with Redis queue system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of four main controllers:

1. **App Controller**: Web interface, OAuth authentication, and WebSocket terminal connections
2. **Generator Controller**: Creates new k8s environments (DinD pods) based on user requests
3. **Collector Controller**: Periodically checks for expired environments and marks them for cleanup
4. **Killer Controller**: Terminates environments that have been marked for shutdown

All controllers communicate through a Redis queue system, ensuring scalable and reliable operation.

## üîß Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.20+)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- `helm` 3.0+
- Google Cloud Platform project with OAuth 2.0 credentials

### Installation

1. **Add the Helm repository**
   ```bash
   helm repo add k8s-playground https://tyottodekiru.github.io/k8s-playground/
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Configure Google OAuth Credentials**
   
   Create a values file (`my-values.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   auth:
     google:
       clientId: "your_google_client_id"
       clientSecret: "your_google_client_secret"
     sessionKey: "your_secure_session_key"
   
   baseURL: "https://k8s-playground.yourdomain.com"
   
   ingress:
     enabled: true
     hosts:
       - host: k8s-playground.yourdomain.com
         paths:
           - path: /
             pathType: Prefix
   ```

3. **Install K8s Playground**
   ```bash
   helm install my-k8s-playground k8s-playground/k8s-playground -f my-values.yaml
   ```

4. **Access the playground**
   
   Visit your configured domain or use port-forwarding for local access:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/my-k8s-playground-app-controller 8080:80
   ```
